    correctAnswer: 2, // The correct answer index (in this case, "-70 mV.")
    explanation: "The typical resting membrane potential (Vrest) of a neuron is approximately -70 mV. This value indicates that the inside of the neuron is more negative compared to the outside, which is crucial for the generation and propagation of action potentials."

    question: "What ion is most responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential in most cells?",
    choices: [
        "Sodium (Na⁺)",
        "Potassium (K⁺)",
        "Chloride (Cl⁻)",
        "Calcium (Ca²⁺)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1, // The correct answer index (in this case, "Potassium (K⁺).")
    explanation: "Potassium (K⁺) is the ion most responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential in most cells. The higher permeability of the cell membrane to K⁺ ions compared to Na⁺ ions at rest leads to a net negative charge inside the cell, establishing the resting membrane potential."
},
{
    question: "Which equation is used to calculate the equilibrium potential of an ion?",
    choices: [
        "Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation",
        "Michaelis-Menten equation",
        "Nernst equation",
        "Henderson-Hasselbalch equation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2, // The correct answer index (in this case, "Nernst equation.")
    explanation: "The Nernst equation is used to calculate the equilibrium potential of an ion. It allows for the determination of the electrical potential difference across a membrane that exactly balances the concentration gradient for that ion."

    question: "During an action potential, which ion influx causes depolarization of the neuron?",
    choices: [
        "Potassium (K⁺)",
        "Sodium (Na⁺)",
        "Chloride (Cl⁻)",
        "Calcium (Ca²⁺)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1, // The correct answer index (in this case, "Sodium (Na⁺).")
    explanation: "During an action potential, the influx of sodium ions (Na⁺) causes depolarization of the neuron. This rapid influx of Na⁺ ions results in the membrane potential becoming more positive, which is a key characteristic of the depolarization phase of the action potential."
},
{
    question: "What happens to the membrane potential during hyperkalemia?",
    choices: [
        "It becomes more negative",
        "It becomes more positive",
        "It remains the same",
        "It fluctuates randomly"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1, // The correct answer index (in this case, "It becomes more positive.")
    explanation: "During hyperkalemia, the concentration of potassium ions (K⁺) outside the cell increases, which reduces the concentration gradient for K⁺. As a result, the resting membrane potential becomes more positive (depolarized), making the neuron more excitable."
},
{
    question: "A patient presents with muscle weakness, hyporeflexia, and ECG changes. Lab results show hypokalemia. What effect would this have on the resting membrane potential of muscle cells?",
    choices: [
        "It will become more positive",
        "It will remain unchanged",
        "It will become more negative",
        "It will fluctuate without a pattern"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2, // The correct answer index (in this case, "It will become more negative.")
    explanation: "In hypokalemia, the decreased concentration of potassium ions (K⁺) outside the cell increases the concentration gradient for K⁺, leading to a greater efflux of K⁺ from the cell. This results in hyperpolarization, causing the resting membrane potential to become more negative."
},
{
    question: "A 35-year-old male presents with muscle cramps and weakness after excessive diuretic use. Blood tests show low potassium levels. Which of the following changes is most likely to be seen in his muscle cells?",
    choices: [
        "Increased excitability due to depolarization",
        "Decreased excitability due to hyperpolarization",
        "Normal excitability",
        "Increased excitability due to hyperpolarization"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1, // The correct answer index (in this case, "Decreased excitability due to hyperpolarization.")
    explanation: "In hypokalemia, the decreased extracellular potassium concentration leads to increased efflux of potassium from muscle cells, causing hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization results in decreased excitability of the muscle cells, making it harder for them to depolarize and contract."
},
{
    question: "A 50-year-old female presents with severe hyperkalemia secondary to kidney failure. What would you expect to happen to the excitability of her neurons?",
    choices: [
        "Increased excitability",
        "Decreased excitability",
        "No change in excitability",
        "Fluctuating excitability"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0, // The correct answer index (in this case, "Increased excitability.")
    explanation: "In hyperkalemia, the increased concentration of potassium ions (K⁺) outside the neuron reduces the potassium gradient across the membrane, leading to a depolarized resting membrane potential. This depolarization increases the excitability of neurons, making them more likely to fire action potentials."
},
{
    question: "A patient with Addison’s disease presents with hyperkalemia. How would this affect the likelihood of his cardiac myocytes firing an action potential?",
    choices: [
        "Less likely due to hyperpolarization",
        "Less likely due to depolarization block",
        "More likely due to hyperpolarization",
        "More likely due to depolarization block"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1, // The correct answer index (in this case, "Less likely due to depolarization block.")
    explanation: "In hyperkalemia, the elevated potassium levels outside the cardiac myocytes can lead to a condition known as depolarization block. This occurs because the resting membrane potential becomes more positive, and the cardiac myocytes may remain in a partially depolarized state, making it difficult for them to reach the threshold for firing an action potential. As a result, the likelihood of action potentials firing decreases."
},
{
    question: "A 45-year-old male presents with muscle weakness and arrhythmias. Lab results show hyperkalemia. What would you expect to see in his cardiac myocytes’ resting membrane potential?",
    choices: [
        "It will become more negative",
        "It will become more positive",
        "It will stay the same",
        "It will fluctuate unpredictably"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1, // The correct answer index (in this case, "It will become more positive.")
    explanation: "In hyperkalemia, the increased extracellular potassium concentration reduces the potassium gradient across the cardiac myocyte membrane, causing the resting membrane potential to become more positive (depolarized). This can lead to increased excitability of the myocytes and potentially contribute to arrhythmias."
},
{
    question: "A patient suffers from a genetic disorder that affects voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to prolonged depolarization. Which phase of the action potential would be most affected?",
    choices: [
        "Depolarization",
        "Repolarization",
        "Resting potential",
        "Hyperpolarization"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1, // The correct answer index (in this case, "Repolarization.")
    explanation: "If voltage-gated sodium channels are affected, leading to prolonged depolarization, it would primarily impact the repolarization phase of the action potential. Normally, after depolarization, sodium channels inactivate and potassium channels open to restore the resting membrane potential. Prolonged depolarization suggests that repolarization is delayed due to persistent sodium channel activity."
},
{
    question: "In a patient with a severe burn injury, changes in potassium levels are suspected to cause hyperpolarization of cells. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this?",
    choices: [
        "Hypokalemia",
        "Hyperkalemia",
        "Hypernatremia",
        "Hyponatremia"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0, // The correct answer index (in this case, "Hypokalemia.")
    explanation: "Hypokalemia refers to low potassium levels in the blood, which increases the resting membrane potential (makes it more negative) and can lead to hyperpolarization of cells. This occurs because the reduced extracellular potassium concentration enhances the potassium gradient, causing more potassium to exit the cell and thus making the inside of the cell more negative."
